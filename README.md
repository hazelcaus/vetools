# Features:

## 1. Create a new Project

Similar to [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) for React, this feature offers a familiar playing ground for users familiar with Ethereum and EVM-based blockchains. This effectively creates a project structure to allow users to develop smart contracts, aid in the compilation and deployment of these contracts, and allow a seamless debugging experience.
